# Computer Graphics 200 - Open GL Assignment
This assignment's focus is on using the OpenGL and GLUT frameworks to generate 3D
images, and to control their behaviour using user-input.

Done in CPP, using (potentially?) glm as well as OpenGL 1.2 and GLUT.

Compiling: Makefile should take care of it. Inside the main directory in terminal,
just type make if you have make installed. Should work for Linux/Mac.
